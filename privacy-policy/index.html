      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 2026</p>

      <p>SMT Labs Studio builds mobile apps. This page is used to inform visitors regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use our Service.</p>
      <p>If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that we collect is used for providing and improving the Service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

      <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
      <p>For a better experience, while using our Service, we may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information. The information that we request will be retained on your device and is not collected by us in any way.</p>
      <p>Our apps may collect the following types of information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> Anonymous analytics about how you use the app, including which features you use and how often</li>
        <li><strong>Crash reports:</strong> Technical information when the app crashes, including device type, operating system version, and stack traces to help us fix bugs</li>
        <li><strong>Local data:</strong> Information stored on your device to make the app work, such as preferences and cached data (never sent to our servers)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>Our apps use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you. These services have their own privacy policies governing their use of your information:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play Services</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firebase Analytics</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firebase Crashlytics</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google AdMob</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Service Providers</h2>
      <p>We may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To facilitate our Service</li>
        <li>To provide the Service on our behalf</li>
        <li>To perform Service-related services</li>
        <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to your Personal Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.</p>

      <h2>Advertising</h2>
      <p>Some of our apps display advertisements provided by Google AdMob. These ads may use cookies and device identifiers to show you relevant advertising based on your interests and browsing behavior.</p>
      <p>You can opt out of personalized advertising by adjusting your device settings:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Android:</strong> Settings > Google > Ads > Opt out of Ads Personalization</li>
        <li><strong>iOS:</strong> Settings > Privacy > Advertising > Limit Ad Tracking</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
      <p>We do not operate servers that store your personal data. All app data is stored locally on your device using secure storage mechanisms. Third-party services (Firebase, AdMob) may process data according to their own policies.</p>
      <p>We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

      <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
      <p>Our Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us. Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>

      <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>Our Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we will be able to take necessary actions.</p>

      <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.</p>
