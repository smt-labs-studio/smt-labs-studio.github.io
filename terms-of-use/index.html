      <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
      <p class="last-updated">Last updated: January 2026</p>

      <h2>Terms</h2>
      <p>By accessing any app developed by SMT Labs Studio, you are agreeing to be bound by these terms of service, all applicable laws and regulations, and agree that you are responsible for compliance with any applicable local laws. If you do not agree with any of these terms, you are prohibited from using or accessing our apps. The materials contained in our apps are protected by applicable copyright and trademark law.</p>

      <h2>Use License</h2>
      <p>Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the app per device for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Modify or copy the materials</li>
        <li>Use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial)</li>
        <li>Attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained in the app</li>
        <li>Remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials</li>
        <li>Transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by SMT Labs Studio at any time. Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the termination of this license, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether in electronic or printed format.</p>

      <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>The materials within our apps are provided on an 'as is' basis. SMT Labs Studio makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights.</p>
      <p>Further, SMT Labs Studio does not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use of the materials in its apps or otherwise relating to such materials or on any sites linked to our apps.</p>

      <h2>Limitations</h2>
      <p>In no event shall SMT Labs Studio or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use our apps, even if SMT Labs Studio or an authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.</p>

      <h2>Accuracy of Materials</h2>
      <p>The materials appearing in our apps could include technical, typographical, or photographic errors. SMT Labs Studio does not warrant that any of the materials in the apps are accurate, complete or current. SMT Labs Studio may make changes to the materials contained in the apps at any time without notice. However SMT Labs Studio does not make any commitment to update the materials.</p>

      <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
      <p>Some of our apps may offer in-app purchases, including auto-renewing subscriptions and one-time purchases. If you purchase an auto-renewing periodic subscription through the Service, your Google Play Store or Apple App Store account will be billed continuously for the subscription until you terminate it. After your initial subscription period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically renew for an additional equivalent period.</p>
      <p>If you do not wish your subscription to renew automatically, or if you want to change or terminate your subscription, you will need to log in to your app store account and follow instructions to manage or cancel your subscription, even if you have deleted your account with us or deleted the app from your device.</p>
      <p>SMT Labs Studio may manage, regulate, control, modify, or eliminate in-app purchase options at any time, with or without notice. SMT Labs Studio shall have no liability to you or any third party in the event that SMT Labs Studio exercises any such rights. All fees and applicable taxes incurred are non-refundable except as required by law.</p>

      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>Our apps may interact with third-party services to retrieve data and provide functionality. SMT Labs Studio is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or in any way associated with these third-party services. Use of any such service is at the user's own risk and subject to that service's own terms and conditions.</p>
      <p>SMT Labs Studio has not reviewed all the sites or services linked to its apps and is not responsible for the contents of any such linked site or service. The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by SMT Labs Studio. Use of any such linked website or service is at the user's own risk.</p>

      <h2>Modifications</h2>
      <p>SMT Labs Studio may revise these terms of service for its apps at any time without notice. By using our apps you are agreeing to be bound by the then current version of these terms of service. We encourage you to review these terms periodically for any updates.</p>

      <h2>Governing Law</h2>
      <p>These terms and conditions are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Spain and you irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in that location.</p>
